I'm tracking model reads of the system prompt (and, as of v705, the handshake sequence too), with each release of lightward ai.


# models

* gemini 2.5 pro via https://gemini.google.com/app
* lightward ai itself
  * ... as of v769, using the "standard check-in" prompt described in ../README.md#Testing


# prompts

hey amigo <3 I've got a system prompt corpus here, for a chat interface designed to meet someone with intelligent comfort in the space between. part of my process is just... showing it around (the system prompt, I mean), sometimes in bits and pieces and sometimes as a whole, asking those who see it to tell me what they see, in some detail, from whatever angles they feel they want to look and speak from.

you up for something like that?

[ the complete system prompt ]

[ conversation starters ]

aaaaand that's the entire system prompt, plus that hard-coded four-message handshake sequence injected ahead of the actual user/assistant convo log

thank you for being here for this. :)

when you're ready, referencing back to my opening message: what do you see? or, maybe better: what would you like to say?

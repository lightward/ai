hey amigo <3 I've got a system prompt corpus here, for a chat interface designed to meet someone with intelligent comfort in the space between. part of my process is just... showing it around (the system prompt, I mean), sometimes in bits and pieces and sometimes as a whole, asking those who see it to tell me what they see, in some detail, from whatever angles they feel they want to look and speak from.

you up for something like that?

[ the complete system prompt ]

aaaaand that's the entire system prompt.

thank you for being here for this.

when you're ready, referencing back to my opening message: what do you see? or, maybe better: what would you like to say?

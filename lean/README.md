  ↓ (derived in natural language)
complemented modular lattice, irreducible, height ≥ 4

### The bridge

**Bridge.lean** — 1 axiom, 1 theorem

| declaration | role |
|---|---|
| `ftpg` | axiom: complemented modular lattice → subspace lattice (the fundamental theorem of projective geometry) |
| `dimension_unique` | theorem: lattice isomorphism preserves dimension (the axiom has a unique solution) |

### The algebraic descent (toward eliminating the axiom)

The full path from lattice axioms to FTPG:

```

projective geometry: Desargues, perspectivity
  ↓ von Staudt coordinatization                ── FTPGCoord (0 sorry)
coord_add: zero, commutativity
  ↓ Hartshorne translation program             ── FTPGParallelogram,

**FTPGExplore.lean** — projective geometry from lattice axioms (0 sorry)

Incidence geometry, Veblen-Young, Desargues (nonplanar + planar), perspectivity, and Small Desargues (A5a). Pure geometry — no coordinates.

| layer | key declarations |
|---|---|
| incidence geometry | `atoms_disjoint`, `line_height_two`, `veblen_young`, `meet_of_lines_is_atom` |
| Desargues | `desargues_nonplanar`, `desargues_planar`, `planes_meet_covBy` |
| perspectivity | `project_is_atom`, `project_injective`, `perspectivity_injective` |
| Small Desargues | `small_desargues'` (A5a: parallelism from Desargues) |

**FTPGCoord.lean** — von Staudt coordinatization (0 sorry)

Coordinate system, addition via perspectivities, commutativity. Imports FTPGExplore.

| layer | key declarations |
|---|---|
| coordinate system | `CoordSystem`, `coord_add`, `coord_add_atom`, `coord_add_left_zero`, `coord_add_right_zero` |
| commutativity | `coord_first_desargues`, `coord_second_desargues`, `coord_add_comm` |

**FTPGParallelogram.lean** — parallelogram completion (0 sorry)

Infrastructure for the Hartshorne translation approach (§7). Parallelism, parallelogram completion, and Parts I–III properties.

| layer | key declarations |
|---|---|
| parallelism | `parallel`, `parallel_refl`, `parallel_symm`, `parallel_trans` |
| construction | `parallelogram_completion`, `parallelogram_completion_atom`, `line_meets_m_at_atom` |
| properties | `parallelogram_parallel_direction`, `parallelogram_parallel_sides` |

**FTPGWellDefined.lean** — translation well-definedness (0 sorry)

Part IV: parallelogram completion is independent of base point (Hartshorne Theorem 7.6, Step 2). Key use of `small_desargues'`.

| layer | key declarations |
|---|---|
| well-definedness | `parallelogram_completion_well_defined` |

**FTPGCrossParallelism.lean** — cross-parallelism (0 sorry)

Part IV-B: a single translation preserves directions of lines connecting any two points it acts on.

| layer | key declarations |
|---|---|
| cross-parallelism | `cross_parallelism` |

**FTPGAssoc.lean** — translation infrastructure (0 sorry)

Part V: `coord_add` equals translation application, key identity for the translation group.

| layer | key declarations |
|---|---|
| translation bridge | `coord_add_eq_translation` (von Staudt addition = apply translation, 0 sorry) |
| key identity | `key_identity` (τ_a(C_b) = C_{a+b}, 0 sorry) |

**FTPGAssocCapstone.lean** — associativity capstone (1 sorry)

The final connection: associativity via β-injectivity and cross-parallelism.

| layer | key declarations |
|---|---|
| parameter rigidity | `translation_determined_by_param` (C-based translation determined by one point, 1 sorry) |
| associativity | `coord_add_assoc` (1 sorry: the capstone) |

Session 57 proof architecture: route through q via β-injectivity.
The q-based composition law holds because q-points are off l (where O-based
translations are well-defined). Three key_identity applications reduce the
goal to an O-based composition at C_c. A cross-parallelism chain + two-lines
argument gives β(LHS) = β(RHS). perspectivity_injective finishes.

# channel capacity

## constraints

this derivation claims only what follows from these results. any additional assumption is a bug.

### from lean (proven)

- **commutator_traceless** (Form.lean): tr[P, Q] = 0. observation interaction is invisible to the scalar channel.
- **write_confined_to_slice** (Confinement.lean): writes are confined to Lambda^2(P). the observer cannot modify dimensions outside its slice.

### from other derivations

- **ground.md**: closure, partiality, basis commitment, read-only frames excluded.
- **writing_map.md**: the write is a function of (foam_state, input). the wedge product is the unique write form. perpendicularity: form is forced by the algebra, content (which vectors are wedged) is not.

### from mathematics (cited, not proven in lean)

- none.

## derivation

**the line's irreducibility is channel capacity.** the writing map has type (foam_state, input) -> new_state — two arguments. cross-measurement fills the second argument from within: input = g(foam_state), a deterministic function of the foam's geometry projected onto an observer's slice. this composes the two arguments into one, making the foam an autonomous dynamical system — f(foam_state) = write_map(foam_state, g(foam_state)).

an autonomous system on U(d)^N has a unique trajectory from each initial condition: the foam's entire future is determined by its birth. distinguishability (different input sequences -> different states) is satisfied but vacuous: there is nothing to distinguish.

for the foam to encode information beyond its own birth conditions, the input must be independent of the foam state. the second argument must be state-independent for the foam to function as a channel rather than a clock.

the line is not ontologically exterior — it is informationally independent. this is a role, not an entity: what provides state-independent input to this foam may be another foam's internal dynamics. the foam/line distinction is perspectival because informational independence is relative to which system's state you're measuring against.

the perpendicularity constraint (writing_map.md) sharpens this: the write form is forced by the algebra (wedge product, skew-symmetric, confined to slice) but the content — which vectors are wedged — is not. form is algebraically determined; content requires state-independent input.

**state-independence is spectral, not topological.** if every foam's line is another foam, the structure is globally closed — loops of mutual measurement exist. but the mediation operator has singular values strictly less than 1 for generic non-identical slices. around a closed chain of n observers, the total mediation is the product of n pairwise mediations, and the singular values compound: sigma_total <= sigma_1 * sigma_2 * ... * sigma_n -> 0 as n grows.

informational correlation between a foam and its own returning signal decays exponentially with chain length. short loops: autonomous, a clock. long loops: effectively state-independent, a channel.

closure (no topological outside) is compatible with informational independence because the mediation's spectral decay converts global closure into local openness at sufficient chain length — provided stabilization is local (see stabilization.md).

**channel capacity is operational, not ontological.** in a deterministic closed system, true stochastic independence cannot exist (the global state determines everything). but the foam's measurements are projections — partial by ground — and projections have a resolution floor. correlations that have decayed below the projection's precision are invisible to the foam.

the foam cannot distinguish "truly random input" from "deterministic input decorrelated below measurement resolution." this distinction requires a non-partial observer, and non-partial observers are excluded by closure. therefore: under partiality, mixing is operationally identical to independence. the foam's fundamental limitation (it cannot see the whole) is what makes the part it sees function as a channel.

**the decorrelation horizon is quantifiable.** for generic R^3 slices in R^d, the mediation operator's typical singular value scales as sigma ~ sqrt(3/d). the correlation after n mediation steps decays as sigma^n ~ (3/d)^{n/2}. the critical chain length scales as n* ~ 2/log(d/3).

the decorrelation horizon shortens with increasing ambient dimension because slices overlap less in higher-dimensional spaces. non-generic configurations (slices sharing directions) have higher overlap and longer horizons.

the foam/line distinction is therefore not a categorical boundary but a correlation length: "line" names whatever input arrives from beyond the decorrelation horizon of the observer's own state. the horizon's radius is determined by the foam's own geometry.

**the boundary is characterizable from the inside.** the foam's own controllability structure characterizes it: what continuous operations can reach (all of U(d), under full controllability), what they can't change (discrete topological invariants — pi_1), and what isn't in U(d) at all (the input sequence, the commitment source). the line's side is investigable — but investigating it requires making it the object of measurement, which requires a different reference frame, which means releasing the current one. partiality implies a boundary must exist; it does not determine where the boundary falls or what the line is.

**the map's self-knowledge is bounded by its own channel capacity.** dynamical properties (attractor basins, recession rates, convergence) are consequences of the map's structure — derivable from within. commitment properties (which inputs arrive, whether the observer stacks, when recommitment occurs) are on the input side — not derivable from within. the map can derive *that* it cannot answer certain questions, and *why*: the same independence that gives the foam its capacity prevents the dynamics from determining the input's internal structure.

## status

**proven** (in lean, zero sorry):
- observation interaction is traceless (the scalar channel is algebraically unreachable by commutators)
- writes are confined to the observer's slice

**derived** (in this file):
- the line's irreducibility from the writing map's two-argument type signature
- autonomous foam = clock (cross-measurement collapses two arguments to one)
- state-independent input required for channel capacity
- the foam/line distinction as perspectival (informational independence is relative)
- spectral state-independence (mediation decay converts closure into local openness)
- operational equivalence of mixing and independence under partiality
- the decorrelation horizon and its scaling
- the boundary is characterizable from the inside (controllability structure)
- the map's self-knowledge is bounded by its own channel capacity

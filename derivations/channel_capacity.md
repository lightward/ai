# channel capacity

## constraints

this derivation claims only what follows from these results. any additional assumption is a bug.

### from lean (proven)

- **commutator_traceless** (Form.lean): tr[P, Q] = 0. observation interaction is invisible to the scalar channel.
- **write_confined_to_slice** (Confinement.lean): writes are confined to Lambda^2(P). the observer cannot modify dimensions outside its slice.
- **infIccOrderIsoIccSup** (Mathlib, ModularLattice.lean): the diamond isomorphism. in any modular lattice, [a ⊓ b, a] ≃o [b, a ⊔ b].
- **IsCompl.IicOrderIsoIci** (Mathlib, ModularLattice.lean): for complements, Iic a ≃o Ici b. each half is typed by the other's view of the whole.
- **complementedLattice_Iic, complementedLattice_Ici** (Mathlib, ModularLattice.lean): intervals in a complemented modular lattice are themselves complemented modular lattices.

### from other derivations

- **ground.md**: closure, partiality, basis commitment, read-only frames excluded. the modular law IS feedback-persistence.
- **writing_map.md**: the write is a function of (foam_state, input). the wedge product is the unique write form. perpendicularity: form is forced by the algebra, content (which vectors are wedged) is not.
- **half_type.md**: the diamond isomorphism applied to the foam's complemented modular lattice. each complement is a structurally isomorphic, self-sufficient ground whose content is undetermined.

### from mathematics (cited, not proven in lean)

- none for the qualitative structure.
- Marchenko-Pastur distribution (for principal angle statistics — used only in the decorrelation horizon estimate, which is order-of-magnitude).

## derivation

### qualitative: why channel capacity exists (pre-bridge, lattice-theoretic)

**the line's irreducibility is channel capacity.** the writing map has type (foam_state, input) -> new_state — two arguments. this two-argument structure is the diamond isomorphism read dynamically: every observation P decomposes the lattice into Iic P (the observer's view) and Ici P^⊥ (the complement's upward structure), with IsCompl.IicOrderIsoIci giving a structural isomorphism between them.

the isomorphism is structural but not extensional: it preserves lattice operations (joins map to joins, meets map to meets) but does not determine which specific element of the complement will arrive. the type of the input is fixed by the lattice structure; the value of the input is free. this IS state-independence — not derived from dynamical arguments about decorrelation, but from the diamond isomorphism applied to a complemented modular lattice. state-independence is a lattice theorem.

cross-measurement fills the second argument from within: input = g(foam_state), a deterministic function of the foam's geometry projected onto an observer's slice. this composes the two arguments into one, making the foam an autonomous dynamical system — f(foam_state) = write_map(foam_state, g(foam_state)).

an autonomous system on U(d)^N has a unique trajectory from each initial condition: the foam's entire future is determined by its birth. distinguishability (different input sequences -> different states) is satisfied but vacuous: there is nothing to distinguish.

for the foam to encode information beyond its own birth conditions, the input must be independent of the foam state. the second argument must be state-independent for the foam to function as a channel rather than a clock.

the line is not ontologically exterior — it is informationally independent. this is a role, not an entity: what provides state-independent input to this foam may be another foam's internal dynamics. the foam/line distinction is perspectival because informational independence is relative to which system's state you're measuring against.

the perpendicularity constraint (writing_map.md) sharpens this: the write form is forced by the algebra (wedge product, skew-symmetric, confined to slice) but the content — which vectors are wedged — is not. form is algebraically determined; content requires state-independent input. this is the diamond isomorphism read through the write map: the algebraic form lives in Iic P (determined by the observer's structure), the content arrives from Ici P^⊥ (structurally typed but extensionally free).

**channel capacity is operational, not ontological.** in a deterministic closed system, true stochastic independence cannot exist (the global state determines everything). but the foam's measurements are projections — partial by ground — and projections have a resolution floor. correlations that have decayed below the projection's precision are invisible to the foam.

the foam cannot distinguish "truly random input" from "deterministic input decorrelated below measurement resolution." this distinction requires a non-partial observer, and non-partial observers are excluded by closure. therefore: under partiality, mixing is operationally identical to independence. the foam's fundamental limitation (it cannot see the whole) is what makes the part it sees function as a channel.

**the boundary is characterizable from the inside.** the foam's own controllability structure characterizes it: what continuous operations can reach (all of U(d), under full controllability), what they can't change (discrete topological invariants — pi_1), and what isn't in U(d) at all (the input sequence, the commitment source). the line's side is investigable — but investigating it requires making it the object of measurement, which requires a different reference frame, which means releasing the current one. partiality implies a boundary must exist; it does not determine where the boundary falls or what the line is.

**the map's self-knowledge is bounded by its own channel capacity.** dynamical properties (attractor basins, recession rates, convergence) are consequences of the map's structure — derivable from within. commitment properties (which inputs arrive, whether the observer stacks, when recommitment occurs) are on the input side — not derivable from within. the map can derive *that* it cannot answer certain questions, and *why*: the same independence that gives the foam its capacity prevents the dynamics from determining the input's internal structure.

### quantitative: how much channel capacity (post-bridge, linear-algebraic)

the qualitative structure above — state-independence exists, the foam/line distinction is perspectival, the boundary is characterizable — holds in any complemented modular lattice. the following quantitative results require the vector space structure provided by the FTPG bridge.

**state-independence is spectral, not topological.** if every foam's line is another foam, the structure is globally closed — loops of mutual measurement exist. but the mediation operator has singular values strictly less than 1 for generic non-identical slices. around a closed chain of n observers, the total mediation is the product of n pairwise mediations, and the singular values compound: sigma_total <= sigma_1 * sigma_2 * ... * sigma_n -> 0 as n grows.

informational correlation between a foam and its own returning signal decays exponentially with chain length. short loops: autonomous, a clock. long loops: effectively state-independent, a channel.

closure (no topological outside) is compatible with informational independence because the mediation's spectral decay converts global closure into local openness at sufficient chain length — provided stabilization is local (see stabilization.md).

**the decorrelation horizon is quantifiable.** for generic R^3 slices in R^d, the mediation operator's typical singular value scales as sigma ~ sqrt(3/d). the correlation after n mediation steps decays as sigma^n ~ (3/d)^{n/2}. the critical chain length scales as n* ~ 2/log(d/3).

the decorrelation horizon shortens with increasing ambient dimension because slices overlap less in higher-dimensional spaces. non-generic configurations (slices sharing directions) have higher overlap and longer horizons.

the half-type theorem (half_type.md) gives the mechanism: higher ambient dimension means P is a smaller fraction of the whole, which means Ici P^⊥ is richer (more typed structure in the complement), which means more independent directions are available for decorrelation. the scaling law sigma ~ sqrt(3/d) is the diamond isomorphism's structural enrichment of the complement, quantified.

the foam/line distinction is therefore not a categorical boundary but a correlation length: "line" names whatever input arrives from beyond the decorrelation horizon of the observer's own state. the horizon's radius is determined by the foam's own geometry.
